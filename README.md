# Lean Notes

Currently published as a series of cards on a collection of Trello boards: https://trello.com/leannotes

This is a working draft. I'm filling it in and adding on as I have the time, going for breadth before depth.

Some chapters will have little to no content beyond a title and a summary. Some Previous / Read On lists will lead off in directions that don't make any sense. Some sections may just link off to a GitHub Issue for details instead of having something written in the text itself (and *that* issue may have nothing in it).

See [issue #1](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/1) for more information on the process of migrating these to GitHub; file a new issue if there's something specific missing that you'd want to know, and I'll answer if I can.

# ![Tag: Chapter Link][] Table of Contents

Right now, I'm experimenting with *multiple* Tables of Contents, sorting by different criteria:

- The first one's the general "order" you might want to go through if reading "cover to cover". It presents things in a somewhat interleaved fashion, explaining ecosystem between mechanics, things like that. It's well paced, but somewhat non-linear.
- The next one's sorted by scope. It's more "linear" and "focused", but more stratified: "learning" isn't as mixed with "doing".

The A lists are generally populated with every new board, whereas the B lists can miss a few.

## Table A: The non-linear-but-paced flow

For people who like their hands-on work mixed with their planning.

I've never been much for "we'll spend this semester in the classroom learning about everything and then next year we'll actually touch something" classes. I like to have the context for everything in front of me as I learn it, so I can check that I understand correctly rather than building up a completely misguided fantasy in my head divorced from reality.

In other words, I'm not a fan of being told about *what there is to do* without being able to *do it*, so this table is laid out making sure you're set up to be able to *act* on each new section *as you get to it*.

### Finding Your Bearings

There should probably be some kind of Foreword here, but I'll defer to the statement immediately above, and the Introduction chapter below.

- [Introduction][]
- [Getting Something Started][]
- [Acquiring Hardware][]
- [Planning and Collaborating][]
- [Naming and Domains][]
- [Branding and Design][]
- [Acting in the Ecosystem][]

### Getting Set Up

There should probably be a statement at the beginning of this section as well: I think it was missing from the board iteration of this because this list was created mostly as a place for overflow after the first list got too crowded.

- [Codeless Solutions][]
- [Development Workspace][]
- [Computers and Phones][]
- [Enter the Web][]
- [Writing for Browsers][]
- [Building App Servers][]

### Building Things Out

Now we're cooking. At this point, you've covered the basic basics, and are ready to start bringing in the significant machinery.

- [Implementing User Accounts][]
- [Utilizing Databases][]
- [Testing and Automation][]
- [Hosting and Infrastructure][]

### Spreading Your Wings

Things are shaped up. At this point, your concerns are turned again outward, toward the world you'll embark into with what you've made.

- [Security and Preparedness][]
- [Email and Phone Numbers][]
- [Usability and Accessibility][]
- [Being Searchable][]
- [Observation and Measurement][]
- [Signal Processing and Reading][]

### Thinking Big

This is another list that I think was split off as overflow from the previous list without a lead-in.

- [Monetizing and Accounting][]
- [Manual Components][]
- [Community Cultivation][]
- [Spread Strategy][]
- [Launching and Releasing][]
- [Going International][]
- [Making the Rules][]
- [Beyond These Notes][]

## Table B: The staged linear flow

Sorted by most of the section's content. Since Lean Notes is written with a flow more like A in mind, the sections aren't strictly laid out like this (education will still have some action a lot of the time). However, there's usually an overall zeitgeist to what a board describes happening.

### Primary Education

- [Introduction][]
- [Computers and Phones][]
- [Enter the Web][]
- [Writing for Browsers][]

### Primary Planning

- [Getting Something Started][]
- [Planning and Collaborating][]
- [Naming and Domains][]

### First Actions

- [Acquiring Hardware][]
- [Development Workspace][]
- [Branding and Design][]
- [Acting in the Ecosystem][]

### Topics for Consideration

- [Usability and Accessibility][]
- [Security and Preparedness][]

### Structural Setup

- [Hosting and Infrastructure][]
- [Testing and Automation][]

### First Construction

- [Building App Servers][]
- [Utilizing Databases][]

### Architectural Education

- [Implementing User Accounts][]
- [Email and Phone Numbers][]

### Responding to Use

- [Observation and Measurement][]
